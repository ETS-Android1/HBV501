# 1. Project vision

## Vision statement

* For people looking for a healthier, more involved lifestyle
* who need to use their ingredients,
* the Natural Ingredient System
* is an information system
* that will provide a wealth of cooking recipes to people that are looking to broaden their diet.
  * The system will provide a variety of cooking recipes that can be accessed right at your fingertips.
  * This system will provide ingredient filtering of recipes to save world food waste.
* Unlike current Icelandic eating habits,
* our product will simplify the decision making process and provide an easy opportunity for people to use
the ingredients they already have.

### 1.1 Background ( What triggered this )

* Based on recent studies it appears that roughly 60% of all web users use the internet on their smartphones. Of that 60% we can also see that 90% of that time is spent using apps rather than the browser itself. This indicates that there is a large market we could reach by providing a smartphone application. Additionally this would make it easier to access recipes while cooking.

### 1.4 Success metrics

* Measure site visitation and engagement and use that to springboard into bigger advertisement offers

### 2.2 Scope of initial release

* The service should have a reasonably sized bank of recipes that can be filtered by desired ingredients.

### 2.3 Scope of subsequent releases

* Creator tier to allow user recipes
* Additional login methods such as Google Credentials or Facebook

### 3.3 Deployment considerations

* A relatively new android smartphone is required to run the application.
* The application requires an internet connection to run.
* It will initially be available on the Google Play store.
