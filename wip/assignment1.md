# 1. Project vision

## Vision statement

* For people looking for a healthier, more involved lifestyle
* who need to use their ingredients,
* the Natural Ingredient System
* is an information system
* that will provide a wealth of cooking recipes to people that are looking to broaden their diet.
  * The system will provide a variety of cooking recipes that can be accessed right at your fingertips.
  * This system will provide ingredient filtering of recipes to save world food waste.
* Unlike current Icelandic eating habits,
* our product will simplify the decision making process and provide an easy opportunity for people to use
the ingredients they already have.

### 1.1 Background ( What triggered this )

* Based on recent studies it appears that roughly 60% of all web users use the internet on their smartphones. Of that 60% we can also see that 90% of that time is spent using apps rather than the browser itself. This indicates that there is a large market we could reach by providing a smartphone application. Additionally this would make it easier to access recipes while cooking.

### 1.4 Success metrics

* Measure site visitation and engagement and use that to springboard into bigger advertisement offers

### 2.2 Scope of initial release

* The service should have a reasonably sized bank of recipes that can be filtered by desired ingredients.

### 2.3 Scope of subsequent releases

* An iOS port of the application.
  - When? When the company provides a test iPhone.

### 3.3 Deployment considerations

* Users who want to use the application should be using a relatively new android smartphone.
  - The application will be made available on the Google Play Store

## User Stories

* Ingredient filtering
  – A user arrives at the website looking for a meal to cook for dinner. They add the ingredients they have
at home. Recipes containing these ingredients are displayed to the user. The user finds a recipe they can
cook with the ingredients at hand.

* Rating sorting
  – A user, having gotten a list of recipes, wants to see which ones are popular. They choose the option to
sort by rating to see which recipes have gotten the best ratings and pick a recipe that appeals to them.

* Account creation
  – A user, who is new to the site, wants to be able to store recipes for future use. They see that there is an
option to create an account. They do so and can then start marking which recipes they want to store.
